                     /note="The lac repressor binds to the lac operator to 
                     inhibit transcription in E. coli. This inhibition can be 
                     relieved by adding lactose or 
                     isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The 
                     symmetric lac operator was optimized for tight binding of 
                     lac repressor."
